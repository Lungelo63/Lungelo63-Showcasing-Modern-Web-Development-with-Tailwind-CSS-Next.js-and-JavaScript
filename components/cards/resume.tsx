        I began my journey in tech when I was in HoÃ«rskool Hoogenhout, where I had interest in problem solving and I realized 
        I was good at figuring things out and wanted to understand how things worked behind the screen. This led
        me to study software engineering. Early on, I found a passion for security and shifted into bug bounty 
        hunting learning to break things before I built them. That mindset carried into my first role at PARCKS,
        where I worked as a full-stack engineer while also auditing smart contracts. From frontend interfaces to 
        backend logic and blockchain systems, I`ve been hands-on across the stack ever since, constantly building, 
        breaking, and refining.
