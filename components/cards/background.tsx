    Born and raised in a&nbsp;
    <span className="text-white underline">small town called Bethal in Mpumalanga</span>, 
    my journey into technology started not from a screen, but from family — specifically, 
    my eldest brother. With&nbsp;
    <span className="text-white underline">17 years of experience in the tech industry</span>, 
    he became a guiding light, showing me how creative, exciting, and impactful technology could be. 
    <br />
    <br />
    <span className="text-white underline">Watching him build</span> 
    and talk about software with passion inspired me from a young age. His influence planted the seed, 
    but it was my own curiosity that made me fall in love with building things from scratch and solving problems through code. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Though I’ve grown deeply technical, there’s more to me than just lines of code. I’ve always loved music, 
    and I listen to&nbsp;
    <span className="text-white underline">Spotify every day while coding</span> — it helps me focus and stay in rhythm. 
    I'm also a naturally curious person — which once led me into the world of&nbsp;
    <span className="text-white underline">bug bounties</span>, before fully diving into full-stack development.
    <br />
    <br />
    I thrive on learning and constantly pushing past limitations, especially when it comes to mastering 
    backend systems, understanding smart contracts, or leading a project from idea to launch. 
    <br />
    <br />
    <span className="text-white italic">
      What started as inspiration from my brother became a personal mission: to create, contribute, and leave 
      a mark through technology that others can build on.
